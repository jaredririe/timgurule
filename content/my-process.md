Using over 15 years of experience, Western Mortgae has developed a superior and streamlined loan process. Whether itâ€™s a purchase or a refinance transaction, we complete as much up-front work as possible to identify and address any potential pitfalls. Our loan process will provide you and your realtor the peace of mind that your offer comes with a pre-underwritten approval. You and your Realtor can have 100% confidence in your loan which will give you the benefit of being able to convey that confidence to a potential seller. Your offer will stand out especially when being compared to a generic pre-qualification from a large bank or online lender.

### Three Weeks

The industry standard is a 4-6 week process. **We've refined ours down to three**:

Week 1

* Day 1: Your loan has already been pre-underwritten.
* Day 2-3: Loan terms and rate lock secured, initial disclosures and appraisal ordered.
* Day 4-7: Underwriting review.

Week 2

* Day 7-10: Any additional underwriting review.
* Day 11-14: Working together to satisfy any underwriting conditions.

Week 3

* Day 14-16: Finalize any outstanding underwriting conditions.
* Day 16-18: Final approval issued. Closing documents sent.
* Day 18-19: Final review with Matt prior to the closing.
* Day 20-21: Close.
